Kill Bill
For this project, I have chosen Kill Bill, a film directed by Quentin Tarantino. The movie centers on The Bride, a former assassin who embarks on a quest for revenge against her ex-boss, Bill, and the assassins who betrayed her. The film is known for its fast-paced, action-packed sequences, stylized violence, and tributes to classic martial arts films. In my project, I will incorporate a minimalist visual design to capture the essence of the movie’s iconic style. The design will feature a black rectangle positioned at a quarter of the screen with a yellow background, symbolizing The Bride’s iconic yellow jumpsuit. The title “Kill Bill” will also be displayed prominently, staying true to the original movie's visual aesthetic.

The project will be interactive, responding to mouse clicks. When the user clicks the screen, the black rectangle and the text "Kill Bill" will be sliced at the click point, with a red blood trail left behind to emphasize the violent, fast-cutting action sequences typical of the film. This interactive element aims to replicate the visual intensity of the movie, where precision and violence play significant roles. I plan to experiment with how to translate the slashing motion and blood splatter seen in the movie’s fight sequences into dynamic, user-driven interactions. This will allow the user to engage with the project in a way that reflects the movie's energy and style, combining visual elements and responsive feedback to recreate the visceral experience of Kill Bill
